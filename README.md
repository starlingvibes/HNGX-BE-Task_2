# HNGX-BE-Task_2

My Golang solution to the second task in the Backend Track of the HNGX Internship programme.

## :dart: Objective

You are to build a simple REST API capable of CRUD operations on a "person" resource, interfacing with any database of your choice. Your API should dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. Accompany the development with UML diagrams to represent your system's design and database structure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirements

The information required includes:

- Functional REST API: The API should successfully perform all CRUD operations.

- Modelling Diagrams: Clear and accurate UML and E-R diagrams should be provided.

- Effective Testing Script: The script should successfully test all the CRUD operations without manual intervention.

- Dynamic Parameter Handling: The API should correctly handle and respond to different parameters provided.
- GitHub Repository: Repository should be well-organized, contain all necessary files, and be publicly accessible.

- Detailed Documentation: Documentation should provide clear guidance on how to use the API, including setup, request/response formats, and sample usage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Documentation
